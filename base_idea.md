We are building a cross-browser browser extension backed by a Next.js web platform to deliver an AI-powered text enhancement and rewriting experience. The extension integrates into the user workflow through a right-click browser context menu, enabling instant rewriting, rephrasing, and text enhancement of selected text. The extension provides a popup interface for personalization and configuration, including options such as tone selection, language indication, subscription status, and credit usage visibility. All extension requests route securely through a backend API layer, ensuring no API keys, sensitive logic, or model processing occur on the client side. Extension state and preferences are stored using browser storage APIs, maintaining compatibility across SPAs and dynamically rendered environments. The AI generation layer is abstracted to allow future model switching without architectural changes. The product will also be distributed as a Shopify app, embedding extension capabilities into the merchant ecosystem.

The system supports a credit-based licensing model with multiple subscription tiers. A free plan offers 50 generation credits with a 10-day validity period, and lifetime access limited to testing purposes. The Lifetime Launch Offer—the primary public release plan—grants one-time lifetime access for 97 USD, with 500 generation credits renewed monthly, capped at the first 500 subscribers. This plan includes real-time counters displaying total subscribers and remaining lifetime offers to create transparency and urgency. Additional plans include monthly recurring subscriptions—Basic at 17 USD for 350 credits, Pro at 37 USD for 700 credits, and Business at 57 USD for 1500 credits. Annual variants of the recurring plans apply a 25% discount when prepaid for 12 months.

The platform rewrites text with guaranteed high quality for English, Arabic, and French. For all other languages, the system attempts generation but applies automated quality checks at the backend. If AI output is detected as low-confidence, poor-quality, or unreliable, responses are gated with a message indicating limited language support, ensuring consistent user experience and preventing misleading results.

Non-functional principles prioritize security by design, backend-enforced authentication and authorization, subscription validation, usage limits, request timeouts, retry caps, and graceful handling of API failures to prevent infinite loops or hung requests. The extension architecture emphasizes modular prompting, centralized theming and branding for rapid style updates, a flexible AI interface layer, broad compatibility with modern web applications, efficient communication with backend services, lint-enforced code hygiene, and extensibility for future enhancement features. The overall system is developed within a monorepo architecture to maintain cohesion across extension, backend, and web packages while supporting scalable distribution, updates, and future growth.
