### ✅ **Issues and Required Fixes**

1.  **Styling**
    
    -   `entrypoints/popups` do **not use the global Tailwind common styles**.
        
    -   Consider building a **shared UI package** to be used by both **extension** and **web** to reduce style inconsistency and duplicated code.
        
2.  **Code Quality**
    
    -   Many **unused functions** exist inside the web `libs`.
        
    -   Implement a strategy to **automatically detect and resolve unused code**, ideally using **AI-generated cleanup**.
        
    -   The following file is completely unused and should be removed:
        
        swift
        
        Copy code
        
        `apps/extension/entrypoints/popup/components/Toast.tsx`
        
3.  **Payment System**
    
    -   Payment logic is **mixed between old and new implementations**.
        
    -   It is **not centralized**, so it needs to be **refactored and unified** into a single source of truth.
        
4.  **Extension Errors**
    
    -   No **ESLint configuration** is present in the extension.
        
    -   There are **TypeScript errors** that need resolution.
        
5.  **Environment Configuration**
    
    -   The web project uses `.local` patterns inside `.env`, while the extension does not — these should be aligned.
        
    -   Configuration for **Supabase functionality is not working yet**.
        
    -   **Middleware is not fully configured**, so authentication handling may be incomplete.
        
    -   Ensure the app works in both **production and development environments**.
        
6.  **Deployment & Client Config**
    
    -   Missing required configuration files such as:
        
        -   `netlify.toml`
            
        -   Shopify configuration
            
        -   Other deployment and environment requirements
            
    -   Verify **production readiness** for all parts.
        
7.  **Assets**
    
    -   The `public/` directory contains **multiple asset folders**, and it is unclear which are actually used.
        
    -   Confirm that **all assets inside `public/` are being consumed properly** and clean unused folders if needed.
        
8.  **Testing**
    
    -   Tests exist but **may require fixes and updates**.
        
9.  **Client Domain**
    
    -   Add the **new client domain** to the project configuration.
