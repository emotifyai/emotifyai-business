Here is a **clean, short, and clear rephrased version** with easy words and direct implementation focus:

## Updated Requirement – EmotifyAI Editor Redirection

### Objective

Based on current testing, the browser extension should **stop using an internal popup** and instead **redirect users to a central web editor page**.

When a user:
**Selects text → Right Click → “Enhance with EmotifyAI”**

They should be redirected to:
**[https://emotifyai.com/dashboard/editor](https://emotifyai.com/dashboard/editor)**

This editor page must also work **without the extension**, so users can type or paste text manually (useful for sites that block extensions).

---

## New Editor Page Behavior

### 1. Text Input

The editor must support three input methods:

* Text sent from the extension (selected text)
* Manual typing
* Copy & paste

---

### 2. Dual Editor (Split View)

* **Left panel**: Original text (editable)
* **Right panel**: Enhanced text (editable)
* Users can edit either side at any time

---

### 3. Text Transformation Controls

* **Tone selection**:

  * Emotional
  * Professional
  * Marketing

* **Language handling**:

  * Input language is **auto-detected** (no select box)
  * Add a **new select box for output language**

* **Strength indicator**:

  * Controls how long / strong the output text is
  * Requires a well-designed system prompt to respect this setting

* **Actions**:

  * the existsing configuration setup
  * Generate / Regenerate

---

### 4. Usage Control

* Show usage status (example):

  * *You used 10 / 10 free enhancements*
* When free usage is finished:

  * Disable transformation actions
  * Show a clear message
  * Display an **Upgrade** button
  * Do not allow re-generation without a subscription

---

### 5. History Section

* Add a **History panel** on the editor page

* Each item shows:

  * Original text (truncated)
  * Enhanced text (truncated)

* History features:

  * Allow editing both original and enhanced text
  * Allow re-running edited input with different parameters
  * Keep history for **7 days only**
  * Automatically delete history after 7 days

---

## Change Summary

**Old behavior**

* Extension opens a popup
* Popup contains editor + settings

**New behavior**

* Extension redirects to the web editor page
* Editor + history are handled entirely on the dashboard
* Web editor works with or without the extension
